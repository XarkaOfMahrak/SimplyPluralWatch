An app that allows you to view & update your front status via your watch!

### local.properties
This file should look like:

```
sdk.dir=/Users/USER_NAME/Library/Android/sdk
apiKey="API_KEY"
systemID="SYS_ID"
spURI="https://api.apparyllis.com/v1/"
```

### How to put on your watch

Right now this is not an official client for simply plural and does not pair with the app, as such it is not released in the play store. To put it on your device you must follow these instructions.
